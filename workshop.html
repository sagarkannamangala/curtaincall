Improv is unscripted theatre: actors use trust and creative instinct to create situations and characters on the spot. 
Sharpen your instincts and build confidence for confronting any situation, be it on stage, on-camera, an audition, business 
presentation, public speaking engagement or interview. Tony Republicano has been an onsite and outreach instructor here at Curtain Call
 since the beginning and is proud to be on the Connecticut Office of the Arts Teaching Artist Roster. He brings a variety of theatre 
 programs to schools and community settings throughout the tri-state area, is on the teaching staff at Yale medical school's Standardized
  Patient Program and performs social-issue theatre with the mobile Interactive Educational Theatre. He is a member of SAG-AFTRA
   whose Film credits include The Amazing Spider Man 2, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Annie. Tony also appears on TV and local stages.
